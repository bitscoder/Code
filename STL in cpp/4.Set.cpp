//In this video we will learn how to use std set in cpp programming language, and few important points to remember are as follows :
//1. std::set is an Associative Container that contains a sorted set of unique objects of type Key.
//2. It is usually implemented using Red-Black Tree.
//3. Insertion, Removal, Search have logarithmic complexity.
//4. If we want to store user defined data type in set then we will have to provide 
  // compare function so that set can store them in sorted order.
//5. We can pass the order of sorting while constructing set object.
